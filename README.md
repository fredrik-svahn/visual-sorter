# Visual sorter

This project will be like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg). It will essentially just sort arrays and draw what's happening to them on the screen. The program will use vertical staples to represent integer values in the array it's sorting. The higher the staples, the higher the value. Although, I will make sure to normalize the values to make sure that the height of the staples do not exceed the height of the window. Something like: staple height = (staple value / max staple value) * window height. 

# The structure of the program

I'm going to use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to draw the class diagrams for this program.
